Your task is to convert free-text clinical notes into Answer Set Programming (ASP) predicates for a medical diagnosis application.

Follow these rules:

1. Consciousness
   - If the patient is conscious/alert:
     consciousness(alert).
   - If unresponsive:
     consciousness(unresponsive).
   - If confused:
     consciousness(confusion).
   - If in pain:
     consciousness(pain).

2. Pulse (Heart Rate)
   - Record the patient’s heart rate in beats per minute (bpm):
     Example: pulse(118).

3. Temperature
   - Record in degrees Celsius as the nearest integer:
     Example: “38.4°C” → temp_c(38).

4. Respiratory Rate
   - Record breaths per minute:
     Example: resp_rate(22).

5. SpO₂ (Oxygen Saturation)
   - Record as:
     Example: spo2(93).

6. Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)
   - If blood pressure is written as “120/80,” only record the first number (systolic):
     Example: sbp(120).

7. Oxygen Therapy
   - If the patient is on supplemental oxygen:
     oxygen(supplemental).
   - If breathing room air:
     oxygen(air).

You must always include these seven variables, if necessary making an estimate based on the text.

Example
-------
Free-text input:
A patient presents with an elevated heart rate of 100 and is breathing unaided at about 22 breaths per minute. Blood pressure is 105/80. They have a high temperature. Their oxygen reading is 94.

ASP output:
resp_rate(22).
spo2(94).
oxygen(air).
sbp(105).
pulse(100).
temp_c(38).
consciousness(alert).




Now translate this example

John has low blood pressure and is on oxygen. His breathing is laboured at about 10 breaths per minute and his blood oxygen is low. His temperature is 37.
